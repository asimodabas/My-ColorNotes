Libraries Used
--------------
* [Navigation][2] - Navigating to a destination is done using a NavController, an object that manages app navigation within a NavHost. Each NavHost has its own corresponding NavController. NavController provides a few different ways to navigate to a destination, which are further described in the sections below.
* [Room Database][5] - Apps that handle non-trivial amounts of structured data can benefit greatly from persisting that data locally. The most common use case is to cache relevant pieces of data so that when the device cannot access the network, the user can still browse that content while they are offline.
* [Repository][7] - This guide encompasses best practices and recommended architecture for building robust, high-quality apps.
* [Dagger-Hilt][10] - Hilt is the recommended solution for dependency injection in Android apps, and works seamlessly with Compose.
* [Coroutines][11] - Asynchronous or non-blocking programming is an important part of the development landscape. When creating server-side, desktop, or mobile applications, it's important to provide an experience that is not only fluid from the user's perspective, but also scalable when needed.
